Music Festival registration and scheduling software

This software, originally published and operated in 2003, was for the Las Vegas Music Teacher's Fall Festival. 
These festivals allow students from all schools and even private institutes to perform in front of a judge and be rated.
The judge rates the student according to difficulty of the piece performed and the level of the student. 
These are not competitions; there are no winners or losers (although some students and teachers will tell you differently!)

The Festival has a number of phases: the registration phase, where studios and teachers register their students;
the Scheduling phase, during which registered studios assign thier students to a performance time slot; and the
judging phase, where students perform and the judges score the performances. 

This system handles the registration, scheduling, and performance phases, and has some rudimentary reporting of scores
for teachers and students.
