Music Festival registration and scheduling software

This software was originally published and operated in 2003 for the Las Vegas Music Teacher's Fall Festival. This festival allowed students from schools and studios in the area to perform in front of a judge and be rated. The judge rated the student according to difficulty of the piece performed and the level of the student. This wasn't a competition; there were no winners or losers (although some students and teachers will tell you differently!)

The Festival has a number of phases: the registration phase, where studios and teachers register their students; the Scheduling phase, during which registered studios assign their students to a performance time slot; and the judging phase, where students perform and the judges score the performances. 

This system handles the registration, scheduling, and performance phases, and has some rudimentary scores reporting for teachers and students.
