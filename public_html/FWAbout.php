<p>
FestivalWare.Net,LLC, a Nevada corporation, was developed to promote music festivals through 
reduction in administrative and technical requirements. FestivalWare conforms to the 
National Federation of Music Clubs regulations stated in the Festivals Bulletin for 2004-2006. 
All events, classes, and reports are specific to the Bulletin's requirements, so you don't have to worry!<br>
<br>


FestivalWare takes the paper out of the paperwork, and spreads the registration and tracking duties
among the many members of your organization, rather than relying on your organization's leadership
to do it all. By reducing and even eliminating most of the paper, FestivalWare reduces collating and 
mailing costs and time. By enforcing due dates, FestivalWare helps keep the music festival on schedule.
<br>
<br>
FestivalWare is a great benefit to your organization. The small cost of FestivalWare is more than
offset by the savings in your time and aggravation, not to mention the savings in postage and printing costs.
