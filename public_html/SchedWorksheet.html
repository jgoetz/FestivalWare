  <p>Hello! During this tutorial, you will see how simple it is to schedule your 
    students.</p>
  <p>Login to the FestivalWare website (<a
href="http://www.festivalware.net/">www.festivalware.net</a>). Enter your Organizer 
    Login information, and click the Login button</p>
  <p>Once at Studio Administration, click on the View Schedule button.</p>
  <p><img width=429 height=250

  <p> The View Schedule selection shows all the available times for performances 
    and all the room assignments and performance levels. You may have to scroll 
    the window to see all the possible selections. (The View Schedule page looks 
    just like the regular schedule page, but you can't add students from here). 
    Plan out where you would like to schedule your students. Pay particular attention 
    to specialties like ensembles, voice, and flute students! </p>
  <p><b>Note: Piano Duos and Concertos are to be scheduled only in room HFA 147 
    regardless of class level.</b></p>

Once you have an idea as to where you would like your students, click the 
    <b>Go To Scheduling</b> button at the top of the page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will see this on the first scheduling page:</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=576 height=162
src="SchedWorksheet_files/image004.jpg"></p>
  <p>Note: If you have all your performances scheduled, you will get a message 
    stating that you have no more students to schedule. </p>
  <p>Select a student from the drop down list, as shown here:</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=576 height=154
src="SchedWorksheet_files/image005.jpg"></p>
  <p>Now click the Select Room and Time button at the bottom of the window.</p>
  <p>You will go to the Scheduling page. The top of the page looks like this:</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=576 height=268
src="SchedWorksheet_files/image006.jpg"></p>
  <p>Note that Wilma's two selections and her total playing time are listed in 
    <b><span style='color:#339966'>green</span></b>.</p>
  <p>If you want to select a different student, jump back to the Administration 
    page, or Logout, just click one of the buttons. Nothing will happen to the 
    schedule if you do.</p>
  <p>The body of the Scheduling page looks like this (see below). Notice the green 
    headers across the table for each hour. These list the room numbers, the judging 
    levels, and what performances should be scheduled in the rooms. Note that 
    room HFA 147 (first column) is for events requiring two pianos. HFA 147 is 
    also for solo piano events as indicated in the header. The Voice and Flute 
    studios are listed on the table to the right hand side (sorry, you can't see 
    them here, I ran out of room!).</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=540 height=678
src="SchedWorksheet_files/image007.jpg"></p>
  <p>Let me point out a few things here. First, notice in this example that room 
    HFA 212 (second column) is unavailable at 8:05 and 8:10. Another teacher has 
    already scheduled a student then. I  won't be able to select either of those 
    times. </p>
  <p>Notice also that the same room has a red Judging label starting at 9:00. 
    You guessed it… in this example, that's when I will be judging! Obviously, 
    I can't schedule Wilma in my room when I'm judging.</p>
  <p>Finally, notice that room HFA 222 has a blue block at 8:15. Barney is one 
    of my students, and I have already scheduled him to perform at that time. 
    His performance is less than 5 minutes long, so he only needs one time &quot;block&quot;. 
  </p>
  <p>To schedule Wilma (remember her, from the page before? We selected her from 
    a list), I simply click on whichever time I would like to place her. Clicking 
    on a time slot takes me to the final page, which will tell me whether the 
    process was a success or not. If there wasn't enough time for the performance 
    I will get an error, as shown below. I can return to the schedule page and 
    try again. In this example, I tried to schedule a 15 minute performance at 
    8:10 in room HFA 222 (right before Barney's time…see above).</p>

  <p><img width=164 height=126
src="SchedWorksheet_files/image009.jpg" align=left hspace=12>To remove a performance 
    from the schedule, click on the <b>Click to Remove</b> button at the bottom 
    of the blue entry box. No, you can't unschedule other people's students! Scheduling 
    is first come, first served, so login early!</p>
  <p>Removing a performance from the schedule will place it back in your list 
    of students and unscheduled events (on the first page of scheduling).</p>
